The robot utilized photoresistors for line detection, applying threshold filtering and averaging techniques to ensure smooth path following. For wall-following, ultrasonic sensors were paired with PID control and Bayesian probability modeling, enabling accurate prediction of corners and responsive navigation in complex environments. A 360Â° object detection system was implemented using ultrasonic scanning and probabilistic modeling to locate and approach target objects within a bounded arena. Averaging filters were applied to reduce sensor noise, and multiple sensing strategies were combined into a unified control framework. The integration of line-following, wall-following, and object-detection modules allowed for adaptive transitions between navigation modes during a model tournament.",
