            "Collaborating with a cross functional team of software developers and UX/UI designers to implement tools and automated test suites using Java, JUnit, Gradle, IntelliJ IDEA, Bitbucket, and TeamCity to streamline feature development for the Globe Pulsed Field System, an advanced medical device technology designed to treat atrial fibrillation through high definition cardiac mapping, single shot pulmonary vein isolation, and atrial ablation",
            "Initiating architectural refactoring of the main production codebase by standardizing reusable patterns and centralizing shared logic, reducing code duplication and strengthening long-term maintainability and scalability across core modules",
            "Developed a configuration management tool using MVVM architecture that analyzes a large-scale multi-module Gradle codebase with JavaParser, applying static analysis and symbol solving to perform abstract syntax tree parsing, type inference, and reference resolution to successfully extract, interpret, and classify 98.6% of software configuration data",
            "Implemented an interactive interface for the tool that supports real time configuration modifications with integrated type checking and validation logic, reducing configuration lookup time to seconds and achieving a 95% reduction in manual configuration errors",
            "Optimized the tool’s performance by leveraging multithreading to parallelize parsing operations and implementing caching mechanisms to optimize data retrieval, eliminating redundant computations and improving end-to-end load times by over 83%",
            "Integrated Gradle (Kotlin DSL) and Launch4j (XML) configurations into the tool’s build and packaging workflow, producing JAR and Windows executable artifacts within a TeamCity CI pipeline with Windows batch scripts to automate execution"
